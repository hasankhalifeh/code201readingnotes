# Process and Design Chaper 18
### When creating a website you should ask yourself these four questions:
    - Who is the site for, it is for everyone not just yourself. Afterwards you need to find your target audience. Once you figured out who your target audience you should start asking questions about who will use your website. While doing this build a demo for yourself so you can see who will be people buying from your website.
    - Why is the site going to be used. WHy would people come to your website and buy from it when there are millions of others. This is where your website comes into play, depending on your interface, colors, smoothing scrolling and prices and there are many more that factor this. 
    - What are your visitors coming to get wheteher its a good deal or a better shopping experiance it all differs from the web content you are trying to create. Once you have figured out what to get now finding the right and ideal market is your next step. 
    - How often people will come to your page. Once you have figured out your product that you want to sell or service you can create your website. If its a turn over website which includes selling shoes then you need to keep updating your website, if its a service then its gonna be pretty straight forward and wont be changing it. If you have a turn over website where items keep selling updating it on a schedule would be much more beneficial to you and customers when buying so they know what they are expecting .

        . Once you have figured out what you want to create and what service or product you want to offer you start building your website. Once you start building your website the most effect strategy to do is a [site-map](https://isotropic.co/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/ecommerce-sitemap-template-or-moqups.png)
        . THe first one should be home and each group has its own page.

## Wire Frames
        . A [wire-frame](https://www.conceptncontent.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/wireframe-cover.jpeg) is a simple sketch that is used to place where your titles and information should go.

## Getting your Message across using design
    1. When desiging a a website it is very crucial for your information to be displayed properly. After writing all the information for the website you should priotize yourself by making it easier for the client to read. 
    2. Visual Hierarchy it refers to the order in which your eyes perceive what is displayed on your website. This is created by visual contrast between what is being displayed.
    3. When putting the information another important step is grouping and similarty so basically put he information that is similar together and group it properly. Diffrent methods for grouping are proximity, closure, continuance, white space, color and borders. 

# Java Script Chapter 1 Abc 

    When learning Java script you first need to become familiar with some key concepts in computer programming.
        a. what is a script and how do i create one?
        b. How do computer fit in with the world around them?
        c. How do I write a script for a web page?

    ## 1/A. What is a script and how do i create one
        - A script is a series of instructions that a computer can follow to achieve a goal. Scripts can be compared to recipes you have to follow a certian order to get a result. 

        - Scripts are made up of instructions which a computer can follow step by step. For example a browser may use different parts of the script depending on how the user interacts with it. 

        - In order to start writing a script you need to first state the goal and then list the tasks that need to be done. Follow the following steps.
                1. Define your goal, defining your goal is the taks you want to achieve.
                2. Design the script, the script is going to be split into different parts where tasks are split up so the computer can understand each step.
                3. Code Each step, each of your instructions need to be written in a programming language that the computer can undersand. 

        Once you understand the goal you want to reach from your script you can work out the individual tasks needed to get here. This can be represented using a [flowchart](https://wcs.smartdraw.com/flowchart/img/programming-flowchart-even-odd-number.png?bn=1510011168). 

    ## 1/B. How do computers fit in with the world around them
        - Computers dont see things like humans understand. THey do not favour anything, for a computer to understand we as programmers have to input data in a squence of steps for the computer to understand and implement the action you wrote. 
        - In computer programming each physical thing in the world can be represented as an object.
        - Both objects share common characterisics, for example a car has different colors and engine, we can even determine their speed this is what programmers call properties of an object.
    
    Methods
        - Methods represent things people need to do with objects. They can get or even update the values. 
        - Methods represent how people interact with an object in the real world. They are like questions and instructions that tell you somthing about that object, or change the value of one or more of the objects properties. 
        - When you use a method you do not always need to know how to it achieves its task, you just need to know how to ask the question.

    ## Web browersers are programs built using objects
        - Window Object the right hand page you can see a model of a computer with a browser open on the screen. 
        - Document object current web page loaded into each window is modelled using a document object.

       ### How browsers see a webpage
        1. Receive a page as html code, each page on a website can be seen as a separate document. 
        2. Create a model of the page and store it in memory.
        3. Use rendering engine to show the page on the screen
