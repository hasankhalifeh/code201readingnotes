# Basic writing and formatting syntax

    ## Headings 
    - Creating headings are determined by the size. If you want your heading to become bigger or small your use the hashtag # for sizes. One hashtag is the biggest, and each hashtag you add makes the heading smaller.

    ## Styling text 
    You can change emphasis with bold or italic or strikethough using the follow commands;
        - Bold is done by adding two stars at the front and end **example**
        - Italic is done by adding one start at the front and end *example*
        - Strikethrough is done by adding sguiggly lines at the front of the text and end ~~example~~.
        - Bold and nested italic are done *** Example text _is_ important ***
        - All bold and italic is used by three starts at the start and end ***example***
    
    ## Quoting text & code
